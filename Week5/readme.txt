Task 1  : Copy data from one database to another with event trigger
For this purpose I've built a pipeline that copies data from a blob storage to an SQL database based on event triggers with the help of Azure Data Factory.
Task 2  : Copy data from one database to another with schedule trigger
For this purpose I've built a pipeline that copies data from a blob storage to an SQL database based on schedule triggers with the help of Azure Data Factory.
It was possible with minor tweaking in the existing event based pipeline.
